      <p id="normal">
        Working on some new stuff for an <a href="http://electricobjects.com">Electic Objects</a> commission. Really excited about this. It's all part of a series called <i>Ornament &amp; Crime</i> that I've been working on specifically for the EO1. All of the pieces are animations that deal with fluid simulation.

      <p id="normal">Water has been bubbling in the back of my mind for a while now. As always, I just need the time to be able to explore one, single, idea/theme.</p>

      <p id="normal">Some of the content is pretty opaque. Others aren't exactly subtle. I try to avoid being to didactic with my work. Low hanging fruit and all that.</p>
