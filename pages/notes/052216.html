        Whoa, long time, no write. This last semester sucked it out of me. Big time. I'm in the middle of teaching the first summer session, too, with similar feels. 
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        The upside is that I can start talking about a few of the projects I worked on during the last year.
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        I finished up my Electric Objects commission. <a href="https://www.electricobjects.com/collections/56/ornament-crime-by-alex-myers">It's here.</a> I had a lot of fun working on these. The people at EO are wonderful.
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        During the past year I worked on three music videos. 
        </p>

      <p id="normal">
        The first, "Phantasmagoria" by the Icky Blossoms, is a VR music video. I worked with the wonderful Eli Piilonen and David Carney of <a href="http://2darray.net">2D Array</a>. I did the art direction, and they made it all work out.
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        The second, "AS CHINGY", by Amnesia Scanner, is another pseudo-VR music video. I worked a bit on early production and concepts with Sam Rofles, but I had to leave the project due to time and budget constraints.
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        The third music video was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5gChGntREg&feature=share">"ghosting"</a> by Chris Hunt. A much smaller project than the other two, I did this one all by myself and aside from a bit of direction from Chris at the beginning, I had complete creative freedom. It was a lot of fun to work on. I got to explore a few ideas and directions I had been thinking about.
      </p>

      <p id="normal">
        It was definitely an experience working on all of these projects with so many different people.
