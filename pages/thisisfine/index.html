      <h2 id="illustrations">Illustrations</h2>

      <p>These computer-generated illustrations are ways for me to process all of the shit I see around me.</p>

      <p>I read a lot - comics, sci-fi, mysteries. My favorites are always the stories that subtly mix the supernatural with the mundane. So those sorts of narrative structures inform my work conceptually. Visually my influences come from a wide array of sources. I love movies. Cronenberg, Carpenter, Lynch. I also love early Netherlandish art. The weird late-Gothic stuff, with its amazing, semi-polygonal cloth, its tight compositional structures and flat, two-dimensional bodies. They also contain a mix of labels in gothic-lettering. Almost a Proto-User-Interface. When I'm working on a new series I often surround myself with books on alchemy, mysticism, and symbolism throughout the ages. I feel it's important to understand these old systems of meaning so that I can mix them with the new systems of meaning. After I've thrown in a bunch of these visual and conceptual inspirations, I usually build one or two small images. Sometimes I'll see something small and random during my day that sends my mind racing. That's when I really start to put the pieces together.</p>

      <p>"I was really interested in the idea of creating this softly moving wall. I also felt placing the panels in a sort of oblique opposition to each other helped create these little pockets of dialogue. The large size helps bring out the small details I like to embed in my works."</p>

      <p>"It's not about anxiety so much as it is about discomfort. By placing the work in a place that causes the viewer to adopt an uncomfortable posture, I hope to use their body as a part of the piece."</p>
