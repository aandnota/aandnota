          I like connecting disparate thoughts. I create surrealistic scenes by exploring the potentials of data transmutation. Cutting, chopping, stretching ideas, forms, and thoughts until they're barely recognizable.

          My research is far ranging and include games, architecture, violence, fear, mysticism, ambiguity, perception, movement, nature, extinction, death, and loss. I'd say that like systems, but I think that's a bit redundant as everything human is built upon systems. It's how we think.

          My methods and materials change to fit the needs of the project, but I spend a lot of time working in 3D environments like Blender and Unity.
