      <h1>Everything To Be Afraid Of</h1>

      <h2>Everything To Be Afraid Of / illustration+installation / Tugboat Gallery / August 5 - 26, 2016</h2>


      <p>from the release:</p>
      <blockquote>
        We live in a horrible time of anxiety and fear. At least it seems like a time of anxiety and fear. I suppose it always does to the people that live through it.

        I think a lot about the horrible things that happen around me. I constantly worry about those horrible things happening to my family and friends. That fear is closer, most easily felt. I feel it most for my kids. A feeling I’m sure many parents share. That deep, gut twisting fear pushes me to find distractions, lest it consume me. In someways I fear that consumption more than anything. I feel like I’m hanging by my finger-tips, from what seems like a great height. As I hang, there’s a small song of doubt that tells me that the height may not be so great after all. The ground could be just beyond my feet. The fall, short and safe. But I can’t let go because I can’t be certain. So I hang here, distracting myself.

        These things that I’ve made are the artifacts of that distraction. They are the manifestations of every anxious bead of sweat.
